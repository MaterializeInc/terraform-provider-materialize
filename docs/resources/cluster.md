# materialize_cluster (Resource)

Clusters describe logical compute resources that can be used by sources, sinks, indexes, and materialized views. Managed clusters are created by setting the `size` attribute

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "materialize_cluster" "example_cluster" {
  name = "cluster"
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The identifier for the cluster.

### Optional

- `availability_zones` (List of String) The specific availability zones of the cluster.
- `comment` (String) **Public Preview** Comment on an object in the database.
- `disk` (Boolean, Deprecated) **Deprecated**. This attribute is maintained for backward compatibility with existing configurations. New users should use 'cc' sizes for disk access.
- `introspection_debugging` (Boolean) Whether to introspect the gathering of the introspection data.
- `introspection_interval` (String) The interval at which to collect introspection data.
- `ownership_role` (String) The owernship role of the object.
- `region` (String) The region to use for the resource connection. If not set, the default region is used.
- `replication_factor` (Number) The number of replicas of each dataflow-powered object to maintain.
- `scheduling` (Block List, Max: 1) Defines the scheduling parameters for the cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--scheduling))
- `size` (String) The size of the managed cluster.
- `use_name_as_id` (Boolean) Use the cluster name as the Terraform resource ID instead of the internal cluster ID.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--scheduling"></a>
### Nested Schema for `scheduling`

Optional:

- `on_refresh` (Block List, Max: 1) Configuration for refreshing the cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--scheduling--on_refresh))

<a id="nestedblock--scheduling--on_refresh"></a>
### Nested Schema for `scheduling.on_refresh`

Optional:

- `enabled` (Boolean) Enable scheduling to refresh the cluster.
- `hydration_time_estimate` (String) Estimated time to hydrate the cluster during refresh.
- `rehydration_time_estimate` (String, Deprecated) Estimated time to rehydrate the cluster during refresh. This field is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use `hydration_time_estimate` instead.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Clusters can be imported using the cluster id:
terraform import materialize_cluster.example_cluster <region>:<cluster_id>

# Cluster id and information be found in the `mz_catalog.mz_clusters` table
# The region is the region where the database is located (e.g. aws/us-east-1)
```
