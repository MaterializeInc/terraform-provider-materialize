## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The identifier for the role.

### Optional

> **NOTE**: [Write-only arguments](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments) are supported in Terraform 1.11 and later.

- `comment` (String) Comment on an object in the database.
- `login` (Boolean) Whether the role can log in. Only available in self-hosted Materialize environments with password authentication enabled. Defaults to `false`.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) Password for the role. Only available in self-hosted Materialize environments with password authentication enabled. Required for password-based authentication. Use password_wo for write-only ephemeral values that won't be stored in state.
- `password_wo` (String, Sensitive, [Write-only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments)) Write-only password for the role that supports ephemeral values and won't be stored in Terraform state or plan. Only available in self-hosted Materialize environments with password authentication enabled. Required for password-based authentication. Requires Terraform 1.11+. Must be used with password_wo_version.
- `password_wo_version` (Number) Version number for the write-only password. Increment this to trigger an update of the password value when using password_wo. Must be used with password_wo.
- `region` (String) The region to use for the resource connection. If not set, the default region is used.
- `superuser` (Boolean) Whether the role is a superuser. Only available in self-hosted Materialize environments with password authentication enabled. Defaults to `false`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `inherit` (Boolean) Grants the role the ability to inheritance of privileges of other roles. Unlike PostgreSQL, Materialize does not currently support `NOINHERIT`
- `qualified_sql_name` (String) The fully qualified name of the role.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Roles can be imported using the role id:
terraform import materialize_role.example_role <region>:<role_id>

# Role id and information be found in the `mz_catalog.mz_roles` table
# The region is the region where the database is located (e.g. aws/us-east-1)
```
