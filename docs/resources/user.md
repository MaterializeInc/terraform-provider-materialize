<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `email` (String) The email address of the user. This must be unique across all users in the organization.
- `roles` (List of String) The roles to assign to the user. Allowed values are 'Member' and 'Admin'.

### Optional

- `send_activation_email` (Boolean) Whether to send an email either inviting the user to activate their account, if the user is new, or inviting the user to join the organization, if the user already exists in another organization. Changing this property after the resource is created has no effect.

### Read-Only

- `auth_provider` (String) The authentication provider for the user.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `metadata` (String)
- `verified` (Boolean)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Retrieve the User ID using the materialize_user data source
# Example of using the data source in your configuration:
#
# data "materialize_user" "example_user" {
#   email = "example@example.com"
# }
#
# output "user_output" {
#   value = data.materialize_user.example_user
# }
#
# The User ID can be retrieved using the following command:
# terraform output -json user_output | jq '.id'

# Import command:
terraform import materialize_user.example_user <user_id>

# Note: Replace <user_id> with the actual ID of the user you want to import
# You can find the user ID by querying the data source with the user's email
```
